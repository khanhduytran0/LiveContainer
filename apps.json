Additionally, we have changed some confusing text.\r \n>[!Note]\r\nDue to a change of LiveContainer's entitlement and a bug with SideStore/AltStore, SideStore 0.6.0+ / AltStore 2.0+ is required to install LiveContainer 3.3.0\r \nNew Features\r\nInstall from URL / Share Sheet\r\nYou can now install apps directly from a URL by using the plus button on the \"My Apps\" page or by using an install URL like \"livecontainer://install?url=xxxxxxx\". Additionally, you can share an IPA file directly from other apps via the share sheet. (Please note that iOS may hide LiveContainer in the \"More\" section\u2014simply tap \"More\" and scroll down to find it.)\r\nShare File to Guest Apps\r\nFiles can now be shared to guest apps when they are running through the share sheet.\r \nImplement 320\r \nJITStreamer-EB Support\r\n[JITStreamer-EB](https://jkcoxson.com/jitstreamer) is now available in LiveContainer. To use it:\r\n\u2022 Set it up first in JITStreamer-EB's website\r\n\u2022 Go to LiveContainer settings->JIT Enabler->Select JITStreamer-EB. You can leave the \"Address\" blank if you are using official server and it's default to \"http://[fd00::]:9172\".\r\n\u2022 Long press the app that needs JIT->Settings->enable Launch with JIT->Tap Run, LiveContainer will contact the server and enable JIT for that app.\r \n>[!Note]\r\nJIT is broken in iOS 18.4 Beta 1, please avoid this version.\r \n\"Entitlement File\" Section in JITLess Diagnose\r\nThe \"Entitlement File\" section is now available in the JITLess Diagnose page, making it easier and more accurate to diagnose issues with your JITLess setup.\r \nPersonal Certificate Support (Untestsed)\r\nLiveContainer can now be used without SideStore/AltStore if you import the certificate used to sign it. Please note that for LiveContainer to work correctly, some changes must be made to the bundle and entitlement:\r\n\u2022 The bundle ID must match the one in the .mobileprovision file without a prefix.\r\n\u2022 LiveContainer must be signed with the get-task-allow=true entitlement, meaning Enterprise certificates will not work.\r\n\u2022 To use the keychain separation feature, LiveContainer must be signed with the correct entitlement. Please refer to entitlements.xml for the required keychain access groups.\r \n\r\nYou can check these criteria in Settings->JITLess Diagnose->Entitlement File. All items except com.apple.security.application-groups should be green.\r \nImplement 54 64 231\r \nUp to 128 Containers Per App\r\nWith the release of SideStore 0.6.0, which fixes the entitlement issue with Keychain Access Groups, you can now create up to 128 containers for each app. Each container created in version 3.3.0 will be assigned a random Keychain Access Group to prevent crashes caused by Keychain Access Group collisions.\r \nHide LiveContainer\r\nTo bypass some app's injection detection, 3 following options are added to app-specific settings.\r\n\u2022 Hide LiveContainer from Dyld Api\r\n\u2022 Don't Inject TweakLoader\r\n\u2022 Don't Load TweakLoader\r \nFor most apps, enabling the first two options should be sufficient to bypass injection detection. However, please note that if TweakLoader is not loaded, some features (like app fast switching) may not be available.\r \nFix 146 338\r \nArchive Option when Installing 2nd LiveContainer\r\nYou can now archive the second LiveContainer instead of installing it directly, allowing you to customize it as needed.\r \nURL to Launch to LiveContainer's UI\r\nYou can now use \"livecontainer://livecontainer-launch?bundle-name=ui\"to launch to LiveContainer's UI\r \nBug Fixes\r\n\u2022 Fix 314: Frameworks in the tweaks folder are now signed and injected correctly.\r\n\u2022 Fix 318: Resolved an issue in fishhook that caused crashes when handling invalid \"symtab_index\".\r\n\u2022 Fix 332: Fixed a dyld issue where the wrong image was being used when dyld functions were hooked.\r\n\u2022 Fix 329: Insert \"LC_ID_DYLIB\" load command to resolve segment-related issues.\r\n\u2022 Fix 358 374: Dopamine's dyld patch is taken into account when bypassing dyld library validation.\r\n\u2022 Fix 381: LiveContainer can correctly close itself when it is hidden.\r\n\u2022 Fix 384: All settings are correctly copied when replacing app.\r\n\u2022 Fixed UI issues when the \"Button Shape\" accessibility setting was enabled.\r\n\u2022 Improved some previously confusing or misleading text.",

Downgrading after updating will result in the loss of all app-specific settings. Please remember to reinstall the second LiveContainer to prevent data conflict.\r\nAdditionally, some apps may display a black screen and crash after 10 seconds in v3.2.0. Please refer to the \"Black Screen Fix\" section below for more details.\r \nNew Features\r\nBlack Screen Fix\r\nThe Black Screen Fix is no longer applied automatically to prevent loading \"UIKit.framework\" before the app\u2019s main executable is opened, which could cause symbol binding issues. You can enable it in Long press app -> Settings -> enable Fix Black Screen\r \nApp Group Isolation\r\nYou can now isolate app groups for different containers, allowing multiple accounts (e.g., in SideStore) to be signed in within separate containers. You can find files inside app group in container folder -> LCAppGroup\r \nYou can enable this feature by: Long press app -> Settings -> (Container name) -> enable Isolate App Group\r\nFix 279\r \nOpen URL Automatically\r\nYou can now automatically open an URL in current app without being prompted.\r\nImplement 285 \r \nIgnore Error During dlopen\r\nThis fixes errors like \"dlsym(xxxx, xxxx)\" caused by app's initializers calling dlsym with a non-existing symbol\r \nFix issues like 124\r \nBetter App Signature Check\r\nThe team ID used in app signing is now considered when determining if an app needs re-signing. This allows apps to be re-signed if they are transferred between LiveContainers installed by different Apple IDs.\r \nJIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page & LiveContainer Help\r\nA new JIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page helps new users quickly identify configuration issues. Problematic items are highlighted in red for easy troubleshooting.\r \nYou can see this page in Settings -> JIT-Less Mode Diagnose.\r\nYou can see LiveContainer help in Apps -> ? Button\r \nBug Fixes & Compatibility\r\nSeparate App-Specific Settings from Info.plist\r\nApp-Specific Settings is now saved in a different file to prevent app from crashing due to reading it.\r \nFix 277\r \nHook dlsym(RTLD_MAIN_ONLY,xxx)\r\nRedirect this call to the app's main executable instead of LiveContainer's to prevent issues.\r \nFix 124 130 140 221 225\r \nDon't Link against UIKit.framework\r\n*This solution is provided by khanhduytran0*\r\n\"UIKit.framework\" is now not linked by LiveContainer's main executable to prevent symbol binding issues. However this will prevent the black screen fix to be automatically applied.\r \nFix 277 272 200 139\r \nApp Hiding Without Device Password\r\nApp hiding now works even if the device doesn\u2019t have a password set.\r \nFix 281\r \n(Regression) Fix 2 Bugs in NSUserDefaultsHook in 3.1.0\r\nFix 276 291\r \nFix long press actions of last guest app remain\r\nFix 235\r \nFix Apps Unable to Open Their Own URL Schemes\r\nFix 44\r \nResolve Crash Loop with Blank \"Info.plist\"\r\nHandles cases where \"Info.plist\" is blank due to app corruption, which previously crashes LiveContainerSwiftUI.\r\nFix 293\r \nFix CallKit Unable to Initialize \r\nFix 258\r \nFix Crash when Patching Store\r\nThe cause of this issue is that LiveContainer cannot access App Group due to incorrect setup.",

You can switch signer in Settings and app-specific settings for one specific app.\r \nRe-Sign Only on Expiration\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the date of expiration of each app's code signature and only signs when its signature is expired. So re-signing happens less frequent than before.\r \nAutomatic Tweak Re-Sign\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the tweaks you added and re-signs it if it is changed or its code signature expires, which makes tweak development with LiveContainer more convenient.\r \nImplement 175.\r \nMultiple Container Support\r\nYou can now create up to 3 containers for each app, so you can log in multiple accounts in different containers(data folders).\r \nKeychains are now semi-separated between app containers. Note that keychains will be removed if you delete a container in LiveContainer.\r \nkeychains created in older version will remain untouched so you can continue using your apps like before. To use this feature, clean up your keychain in LiveContainer settings.\r \nThis feature, along with the following fix of NSUserDefault leak impelements 218 176.\r \nLanguage Selection for Each App\r\nYou can now choose an language for an app in app-specific settings.\r \nImplement 171\r \nApp Preferences\r\nYou can now modify app preferences in LiveContainer like in iOS Settings. To change app preferences, go to app-specific settings -> (container name) -> Container Preferences\r \nImplement 252\r \nForce Orientation Lock\r\nThis option can be used to solve some game having stretched/mal-functioning UI when launched in portrait mode\r \nImplement 251\r \nJITLess Support for Multiple SideStores\r\nIf you use Multiple SideStores with SparseRestore, you can now export the tweaked SideStore IPA and install it manually to enable JITLess mode.\r \nImplement 219\r \nBug Fixes\r\n\u2022 NSUserDefault Leak & Random Signing out: NSUserDefault(app preferences) are now *almost* separated and properly placed in app's data folder.
